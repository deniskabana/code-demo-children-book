## Custom hooks

Any custom hook defined within the project (unless context-specific) should follow the rules of hooks and be placed in the `src/hooks` folder.

Custom hooks can be anything from a simple `useToggle`, custom API calls like `useApiMessages` hook to a more complex `useDataTable` hook.
