## Static assets

We want to self-host fonts, svg icons and other resources used in this project to ensure that the project works offline & is future-proof.

Any type of file that isn't code (e.g. images, fonts, etc.) should be placed in the `src/assets` folder or a custom subfolder, e.g. `src/assets/fonts`.
